This is the Bootstrap 5 branch which is under development.

**Not to be merged with the master branch**

## Ideas

* Remove primeface styling, while keeping primefaces functionalities.
* Streamline CSS by migrating to only Bootstrap5.
* Use SCSS as a css preprocessor.
* Migrate to bootstrap icons - https://icons.getbootstrap.com

## How to contribute
--

* Convert exisiting elements to bootrstrap classes. Inputs, buttons etc.
* Remove exisiting inline styling in current views
* Write new views using Bootstrap 5 classes, include Bootstrap5 classes in newly created views, so they will work smoothly when Bootstap5 branch merge with master.
* Minimize writing inline styles
